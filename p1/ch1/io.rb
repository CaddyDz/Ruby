=begin
  puts adds a newline to the string it outputs if there isn’t one at the end already; print doesn’t. print prints exactly what it’s told to and leaves the cursor at the end. (Note: On some platforms, an extra line is automatically output at the end of a program.) p outputs an inspect string, which may contain extra information about what it’s printing.
